I am a M.Sc. student in the biology department interested in data-driven projects for the biological and geosciences. Biological oceanography, microbial ecology, computer vision and Earth systems science are all considered. My current work centers around quantitative plankton imagery, classification tasks with machine learning, and amplicon sequencing of microbial diversity. The content here will evolve with the times.
